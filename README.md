This is a Noroff's Course Assigntment - JavaScript 1 (The focus is API calls)
https://modest-bartik-b5a061.netlify.app/index.html - My website 

1- Find an API
Search for a public, free-to-use API.

You will need to make two calls to this API:
to fetch an array of results
to fetch a single result using an id, name, or other property.
You will need to read the API's documentation to see what URLs are available, if they require a key to be sent in the header, and any other configuration they might need.
There are many free APIs discoverable by a Google search.

2- Styling
The focus of the CA is on JavaScript, not styling. 
Yet, as a front-end developer you will always need to produce user-interfaces that make sense and are easy to follow. 
You will need to provide navigation to and from the home page (index.html) and the contact page.

3- contact.html
If all validation passes, add a message above the form indicating the form passed validation
